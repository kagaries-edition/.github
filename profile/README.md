<summary>Kagaries Edition</summary>

Kagaries Edition is a project created in 2023 by Kagaries

It was orginally known as "Hardmode Minecraft" before the re-brand to Kaizo Edition, then to Kagaries Edition. "Hardmode Minecraft" pretty much had the same idea and concept as current day Kaizo Edition, but wasn't planned to be as big as Kaizo Edition is now. In fact, Kaizo Edition wasn't even meant to be more then a fun little joke! Now it's named Kagaries Edition because I didn't like the way this project was going, and now we have this!

> Personal Kagaries Note:
> Kagaries Edition is my favorite personal project I've worked on, and the fact I'm able to even have other people helping me is amazing.
